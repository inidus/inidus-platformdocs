As an administrator you have access to a range of admin features which allow you to manage your domain and users.

The admin features are available from the *_Administration_* menu. If your role doesn't allow you access to admin features, the menu will not be shown.

== User Management

An administrator can amend user details for existing users or delete users where required. Users can be quickly activated or deactivated by simply clicking on the *_Activated/Deactivated_* button on the *_Users_* page.

An administrator can also create additional users for their own domain, where it is not desirable or not convenient for these users to use the self service facilities themselves. Users can be given a single or multiple roles.

== Metrics

This page provides a range of different graphical and tabular metrics to allow an administrator to monitor platform activity and view statistical information in real time. Some areas, e.g. *_Threads_* allow further drilling down, indicated by an image:/images/self_service_administration_drilldown.png"> icon.

== Health

As well as Activity metrics, another useful view for an administrator is around the availability and status of various platform components. The *_Health_* feature is designed to provide this information.

As well as seeing a quick overview, the icon on each of the components allows you to drill down and view more detailed information.

== Configuration

The *_Configuration_* feature provides a quick view of the platform configuration settings for an administrator. It includes filtering options to enable drilling into specific aspects.

== Audits

The *_Audits_* feature enables an administrator to monitor all access attempts by all users of the domain. A date filter can be set to enable a more focussed view.
