Download the http://www.openehr.org/download_files/archetype_editor/archetype_editor_2.8.972.1-windows_32bit.exe[latest version] of Archetype Editor.

This installs the openEHR Archetype Editor (ArchetypeEditor.exe) in the folder …

Windows-32:: C:\Program Files\openEHR\Archetype Editor
Windows-64:: C:\Program Files(x86)\openEHR\Archetype Editor

and should set up links on your Desktop or Start Menu etc.

Further details are available at the http://www.openehr.org/downloads/archetypeeditor/home[openEHR Archetype Editor Download page].

== Setup Archetype Editor
. Run the Archetype Editor from the Desktop or Start Menu.
. At the initial screen, open any existing archetype on your system e.g. one of the CKM archetypes previously downloaded
+
 ..\Documents\openehr_training\remote\ckm\archetypes\cluster\OPENEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.device.v1.adl
+
Or one of the sample archetypes provided at
+ 
 ..\Users\Public\Documents\My Clinical Models\Sample Set\Archetypes

== Download Archetypes
The openEHR Foundation Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM) is a web-based tool that stores openEHR clinical models that are developed collaboratively by the openEHR community and made freely available for others to use and copy.

Go to http://openehr.org/ckm[openEHR Foundation CKM] then from the top menu select *_Archetypes->Bulk Export_*.

This will create a zip file with the latest versions of openEHR Foundation CKM archetypes.

Download this zip file and unzip it into the remote/ckm folder you created earlier e.g. *_..\Documents\openehr_training\models\remote\ckm\archetypes_* making sure you preserve the folders.

You should now have something like

----
openehr_training
 local
	archetypes
	templates
 remote
	ckm
	 archetypes
	  cluster
		composition
		demographic
		entry
		section
		readme.txt
----

Depending on how your zip program works you may need to move the unzipped folders around to match this pattern.

=== CKM ‘GitHub mirror’
Git is a common software version control tool. The CKM archetypes and templates are ‘mirrored’ out to a Git repository hosted at the https://github.com/openEHR/CKM-mirror[openEHR Github].

If you are familiar with using Git, you can clone the repository as `git clone https://github.com/openEHR/CKM-mirror.git`.
