summary: This section provides a basic overview of openEHR archetypes and templates
---

The Operon Ehrscape API consumes, retrieves and queries patient healthcare
data using a standardised specification and querying format defined by the
openEHR Foundation. openEHR is complex and can be difficult for novices to
understand (even those with a solid technical background) but the Ehrscape
API considerably simplifies the interface with openEHR systems.

http://openehr.org[openEHR] provides a way for clinicians to define and share
open-source, vendor-neutral clinical information components
(`archetypes` and `templates`) which can be consumed, persisted and queried
by different technology stacks, as long as they adhere to the openEHR
specifications. Examples of archetypes used in this project are `Procedure`,
`Symptom`, and `Imaging result``. These are managed by the openEHR Foundation
using the http://openehr.org/ckm[Clinical Knowledge Manager] tool and mirrored
to https://github.com/openEHR/CKM-mirror[Github], with a CC-BY-SA licence.

A repository of archetypes and templates designed for UK use is maintained
jointly by NHS Scotland, Apperta Foundation and RippleOSI at
http://clinicalmodels.org.uk and and mirrored to a
https://github.com/ClinicalModelsUK/ckm[Git repository]. HSCIC also have an
openEHR CKM repository at
http://ckm.hscic.gov.uk/ckm/[http://ckm.hscic.gov.uk/ckm/].
